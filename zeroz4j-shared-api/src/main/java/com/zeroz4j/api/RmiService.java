/**
 * Marks an interface as a ZeroZ4j Remote Method Invocation (RMI) service contract.
 *
 * <p>The {@code zeroz4j-apt} annotation processor generates client-side Wasm stubs
 * ({@code <InterfaceName>_Stub}) that marshal method arguments into binary payloads and suspend TeaVM coroutines until the server responds.</p>
 *
 * <p>On the backend, incoming binary frames are routed to the CDI bean implementing
 * this interface using Project Loom Virtual Threads for high scalability.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>AI Agent Execution Notes:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Code Generation:</b> Triggers stub generation in `RmiAnnotationProcessor`.</li>
 *   <li><b>Server Dispatch:</b> `WasmRmiServerEngine` scans CDI bean manager for beans implementing `@RmiService` interfaces and Whitelists their methods.</li>
