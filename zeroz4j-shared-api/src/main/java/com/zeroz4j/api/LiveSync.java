/**
 * Marks a {@link Portable} class as a Live Model eligible for
 * transparent, real-time bidirectional state synchronization between client (TeaVM Wasm)
 * and server (JVM) via the zeroz4j {@code SyncEngine}.
 *
 * <p>Live models are tracked by session-scoped reference handles assigned by {@link ObjectMapper}.
 * Field changes modified on the server are automatically pushed to connected clients without
 * explicit subscription code in the UI.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>AI Agent Execution Notes:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Push Channel:</b> Uses WebSocket opcode 0x02 (PUSH) / 0x11 (SNAPSHOT) frames.</li>
 *   <li><b>In-Place Invalidation:</b> When an inbound LiveSync payload arrives on the client, {@link ObjectMapper}
 *       locates the existing instance in Wasm memory and updates its fields in place.</li>
 * </ul>
