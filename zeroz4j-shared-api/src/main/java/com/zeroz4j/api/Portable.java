/**
 * Marks a plain Java class as part of the shared model: portable across tiers as-is —
 * RMI arguments and returns, event payloads, shared signal values, EclipseStore
 * persistence, and the Wasm UI all use the same instance class. One annotation, nothing
 * else: no interface to implement, no DTOs, no mapping.
 *
 * <p>Requirements: a public no-arg constructor and getters/setters (or non-private
 * fields) for every serialized field. Validation annotations from
 * {@code com.zeroz4j.api.validation} may be declared on fields and are enforced on both
 * tiers.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>AI Agent Execution Notes:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Compile-time Code Generation:</b> The zeroz4j-apt processor generates a binary
 *       serializer ({@code <Model>_Serializer}), validation rules ({@code <Model>_Rules},
 *       when constraint annotations are present), and registrar entries for every
 *       {@code @Portable} class.</li>
 *   <li><b>Wire Identity:</b> Instances travel with their runtime class name; the
 *       transport encoding is an internal detail applications never see.</li>
 * </ul>
