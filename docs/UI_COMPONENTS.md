# ZEROZ4J UI COMPONENTS

This document outlines the UI component library in the `zeroz4j-ui-components` module. It covers how layouts and views work, the optional HTML layout system, data binding, and a comprehensive list of all components categorized by their purpose.

## Building Views with Layouts

In zeroz4j, views are built programmatically using Layout components. Layouts act as containers that implement the `HasComponents` interface, allowing you to nest components hierarchically.
By adding child components to these layouts, developers can compose complex UIs purely in Java without writing custom CSS or HTML. The layout classes internally manage standard layout paradigms like Flexbox and CSS Grid. 

Common layouts include `VerticalLayout` (stacking children vertically), `HorizontalLayout` (stacking horizontally), and `FormLayout` for structured input forms.

### Code Example: Basic Layouts
Here is a simple example showing how to create layouts and attach components to them:

```java
// Create a main vertical layout
VerticalLayout mainLayout = new VerticalLayout();

// Create a title and add it to the main layout
CardTitle title = new CardTitle("User Registration");
mainLayout.add(title);

// Create a form layout for inputs
FormLayout formLayout = new FormLayout();
TextField nameField = new TextField("Name");
TextField emailField = new TextField("Email");

// Add components to the form layout
formLayout.add(nameField, emailField);

// Create a horizontal layout for actions
HorizontalLayout actionsLayout = new HorizontalLayout();
Button submitButton = new Button("Submit");
Button cancelButton = new Button("Cancel");

// Add buttons to the horizontal layout
actionsLayout.add(submitButton, cancelButton);

// Attach the nested layouts to the main layout
mainLayout.add(formLayout, actionsLayout);
```

## Optional HTML Layout Feature

While programmatic layouts are powerful, there are times when declaring a layout in HTML is more convenient. Zeroz4j provides an optional HTML layout feature via the `FlavourWrapper` component, leveraging TeaVM Flavour templates.
By passing a Flavour template object to the `FlavourWrapper`, the framework binds the template to a host `div` element (`Templates.bind(flavourTemplateObj, getElement())`). This allows developers to seamlessly mix declarative HTML templates for complex visual structures with programmatic component logic, without sacrificing type safety or data binding.

## Data Binding to POJOs

Input components (those implementing `HasValue`) can be directly bound to data POJOs using the `Binder<BEAN>` class. The Binder facilitates a two-way data flow between your UI components and your Java model.

To use the Binder:
1. Instantiate a `Binder<MyPojo>`.
2. Bind components to specific fields using the builder pattern, providing a getter and setter:
   ```java
   binder.forField(myTextField)
         .withValidator(...)
         .asRequired("This field is required")
         .bind(MyPojo::getName, MyPojo::setName);
   ```
3. Load a bean into the UI with `binder.setBean(myBean)`.
4. The Binder automatically reads from the bean into the fields. Upon a value change in the UI, it validates the input. If validation passes, it writes changes back from the fields into the bean. It also handles rendering error states directly onto the components (e.g., adding `input-error` classes).

## DOM Events and Server Communication

You can easily attach DOM event listeners to components to handle user interaction. In zeroz4j (which compiles to WebAssembly via TeaVM), network calls to the server (via RPC stubs) are synchronous and blocking from the developer's perspective. 

To prevent these blocking calls from freezing the browser's main UI thread, zeroz4j automatically wraps standard component event listeners (like button clicks or text input) in a TeaVM virtual thread. This allows you to write simple, sequential code: the thread is suspended during the network call and automatically resumed when the response arrives, all without any callbacks, `CompletableFuture`, or manual `new Thread()` boilerplate!

### Code Example: Button Click to Server Call
Here is an example showing how to attach a click listener to a button and make a server call. Notice how the RMI call looks completely synchronous!

```java
Button saveButton = new Button("Save Profile");

saveButton.addClickListener(event -> {
    // 1. DOM Event listener triggered on click. 
    // This is already running inside a TeaVM virtual thread!
    saveButton.setEnabled(false);
    saveButton.setText("Saving...");
    
    try {
        // 2. Call server method synchronously via an RPC stub.
        // The virtual thread will safely suspend here without freezing the UI!
        boolean success = userService.saveUserProfile(profile);
        
        // 3. Resumes execution here once the server responds
        if (success) {
            saveButton.setText("Saved Successfully!");
        } else {
            saveButton.setText("Save Failed");
        }
        
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Handle network or server errors
        saveButton.setText("Error Occurred");
    } finally {
        saveButton.setEnabled(true);
    }
});
```

When building your own custom components that hook into low-level DOM events via `element.addEventListener`, be sure to use the `addDomEventListener()` helper or `Component.threaded()` from the base `Component` class to ensure your listeners execute in a safe, suspendable context.
